Steps: not necessarily in any particular order. All scripts should run on their own. 
(0) Download the materials from Github. Obviously you did that:)
(1) Open the R project file called ("PowerSIOP2019.Rproj")
(2) Obtaining the results from the Informative hypothesis simulation can be performed by running the 
    "ContinuousSimulation.R" script. 
(3) Recreating the plots can be done by running the
"Continuous_simulation_results.R"
(4) Some necessary calculations for the design matrix are done in "Continuous_calculation.R". This information is pre-loaded for you. So you don't have to run it (see "Power_ORM_Design.csv" in the Data folder)
(5) Recreating the FPC plot can be done by running "FPC_plots.R"
(6) BayesianSimulation provides the code for the Bayesian simulation and also for the Bayesian Figure.
